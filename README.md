Hi, I’m Shane

- I’m interested in data engineering, analytics, data science, microeconomics, weightlifting, yoga, hiking with my lab Mai, cooking new recipes, and reading anything that expands my views, makes me laugh, or helps me learn. 
- I’m currently working to expand my data engineering and data science capabilities. I'm looking for a role in the field that will challenge me and have a positive impact on the world.
- How to reach me: shane.mccabe27@gmail.com

Have a wonderful day :)
